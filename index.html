   <h1>Cats</h1>
   
     <p>The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet">pets</a> or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.</p>

    <h1>Health Risks</h1>
   <p>Heath risks that are associated with pets include:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Aggravation of allergies and asthma caused by dander and fur or feathers</li>
     <li>Falling injuries. Tripping over pets, especially dogs, causes more than 86,000 falls serious enough to prompt a trip to the emergency room each year in the United States. Among elderly and disabled people, these falls have resulted in life-threatening injuries and broken bones.</li>
   <li>Injury, mauling, and sometimes death caused by pet bites and attacks.</li>
   <li>Disease and/or parasites due to animal hygiene problems, lack of appropriate treatment, and undisciplined behavior (feces and urine).</li>
     </ul>
